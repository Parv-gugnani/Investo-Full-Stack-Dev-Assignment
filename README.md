## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [ShadCN UI](https://shadcn.dev) - For consistent UI components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For utility-first styling
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) - For dark mode support

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of:
- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**: I learned how to use responsive utilities to make the component adapt to both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Dark Mode with `next-themes`**: I learned how to handle dark mode in Next.js with `next-themes` and how to avoid hydration issues by delaying rendering until the theme is set.
- **Using ShadCN Components**: Integrating ShadCN components was a great way to maintain a consistent UI style across all elements, and customizing them for specific needs taught me valuable styling techniques.

### Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to focus on:
- **Accessibility**: Making interactive elements like sliders and toggles fully accessible.
- **Optimizing Theme Performance**: Ensuring smooth theme switching and minimizing flickering on page load.

### Useful resources

- [next-themes documentation](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) - Helped me understand theme switching and avoid common hydration errors.
- [ShadCN UI](https://shadcn.dev) - This library made it easy to add consistent, customizable UI components.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Great reference for creating markdown files like this README.
